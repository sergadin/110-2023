Environmental pollution is a very serious problem today. 
We can allocate the main natural resources that are important to protect and restore in case of trouble — this is air, water and soil.

For example, air pollution can lead to a warming climate and the destruction of human health. 
To avoid this, people use air purification plants. 
Also, switching to electric cars reduces the concentration of harmful substances, because gasoline and diesel cars emit toxic air pollutants. 
And for example, planting greenery helps to purify the air.

Let’s talk about water pollution. 
Water is an integral part of every living organism, so it is important to protect it. 
Installing filters, reducing the use of plastic and its emissions into reservoirs, and controlling emissions of harmful substances into rivers, seas and lakes will help us with this.

It remains to talk about the pollution of the earth. 
The obvious fact is to reduce waste that does not decompose, such as plastic. 
It is also necessary to monitor the release of chemical waste into the ground.
I would like to give an interesting example (case) of the fight against plastic. 
Mexico is one of the world's largest suppliers of avocados. 
And one of the Mexican companies BioFase, using this, began to produce disposable cutlery not from plastic, but from avocado seeds, which completely decompose within 240 days.

In conclusion, I want to say that it is necessary to reduce the use of harmful substances that are dangerous to nature. 
Since the earth is our home and there will be no other, it is very important to protect nature.
