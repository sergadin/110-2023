Fairy tales have inspired music, namely opera, such as the French Op?ra f?erie and the German M?rchenoper. 
French examples include Gretry's Z?mire et Azor, and Auber's Le cheval de bronze, German operas are Mozart's Die Zauberfl?te, Humperdinck's H?nsel und Gretel, Siegfried Wagner's An allem ist H?tchen schuld!, which is based on many fairy tales, and Carl Orff's Die Kluge.
